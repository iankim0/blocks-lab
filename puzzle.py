        A state is a sequence of directions. To generate its successor, we append a direction
        that forces the "snake" to make a 90-degree turn along some axis. In other words,
        one cannot append the direction in which the snake is already heading, nor can one
        append the completely opposite direction.

        For instance, if the state is (U, N, W), then we cannot append directions "W" (the
        direction in which the snake is currently going) or "E" (the opposite direction)
        to derive a successor.

        This method also filters out successors that lead to "invalid" states, as determined
        by the .is_valid_state() method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : tuple[str]
            A state of the search space, i.e. a sequence of directions

        Returns
        -------
        list[tuple[str]]
            The list of valid successor states.
